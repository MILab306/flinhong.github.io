## Frank's Blog

Keep a blog is really an interesting part of my life. Hope you can enjoy the journey as you surf through.

By now, this blog is hosing on Google Firebase with a free SSL. You can visit the most updated site by [https://www.flinhong.com](https://flinhong.com).

## Blog Status

This blog is running with Travis docker, please find the building status below.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flinhong/blog.svg?branch=deploy)](https://travis-ci.org/flinhong/blog)

Since I'm going to update my site, this living site you visited at [flinhong.github.io](https://flinhong.github.io) will no longer update. But you can use it if you like, steps as below.

If you have any questions, you can [leave me a message](https://flinhong.github.io/contact/#message) for discussion ðŸ˜‰.

## Theme Usage

For using of this theme, please fork the original Jekyll sources via my blog repo: [https://github.com/flinhong/blog.git](https://github.com/flinhong/blog.git). It's under the deploy branch.

Of course, the documentary for this theme is not well developed. So, [drop me a line](https://flinhong.github.io/contact/#message) for discussion if any.

By the way, *jekyll-minifier* was used to compress the html, css, and js files. It will slow down the building process and also cannot be accepted by GitHub Pages. If you don't need this, just remove it from `_config.yml` file.

And if possible, please leave a place for linking back to my site or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/flinhong). ðŸ˜‰
